💧 Water Quality Prediction
📌 Overview
The Water Quality Prediction project is a machine learning-based web application that predicts whether water is safe for drinking (potable) based on its chemical and physical properties.
It uses Python (Flask), Scikit-learn, and a basic HTML interface to create an interactive prediction system.

🚀 Features
✅ User Input Form – Input water parameters like pH, hardness, solids, etc.

✅ ML Classification Model – Uses K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm

✅ Data Preprocessing – Cleans, normalizes, and fills missing values

✅ Prediction Result – Displays whether water is Potable or Not Potable

✅ Flask Web App – Runs a lightweight backend server

✅ Simple HTML Interface – Easy-to-use input/output form
